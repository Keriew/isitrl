Some games that could be included but we have not included them yet, either to keep it reasonably short, or due to not knowing much about them.

* Star Trek (1971) -- some call it roguelike, also it has influenced both Rogue and Beneath Apple Manor.
* ToeJam & Earl -- an early example of a roguelike-like.
* Brogue -- not controversial, but could be still included because of being influential.
* Loop Hero -- marketed as 'pushing roguelikes into new direction' (which suggests it is not actually a roguelike).
* Noita -- people in the roguelike community find this game quite close to traditional roguelikes.
* Hades -- not included because it is an "isaac-like" and we usually show one game per genre, but marketed as 'a roguelike for people who do not normally play roguelikes' (which suggests it is not actually a roguelike).
* Don't Starve -- do not know much about this one.
* Project Zomboid -- permadeath without procgen.
* Road not Taken, Fidel Dungeon Rescue -- other interpretations of "puzzle roguelike".
* Invisible Inc -- between XCOM and roguelikes.
* Barony, WazHack -- don't know much about these, but apparently close to roguelikes.
* Hoplite -- yet another popular mobile roguelike.
* Ending -- abstract roguelike.
* Vagante -- spelunky-lke with more roguelike elements.
* Transcendence, Triangle Wizard -- early real-time "roguelikes"
* Crown Trick, Quasimorph, Rift Wizard, Path of Achra, Soulash -- modern, innovative roguelikes in the traditional sense or close (I have not played those).
